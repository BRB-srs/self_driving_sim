# Self-Driving Car Traffic Sign Simulation

This Python script simulates a basic decision-making process for a self-driving car.  
It detects traffic light colors and decides which side to pass:
- *Red* → Pass on the right
- *Green* → Pass on the left

Run the script and enter "red" or "green" when prompted.
